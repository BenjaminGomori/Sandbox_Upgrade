# OCR Facelift

OCR Facelift is a software solution for the Ohio Cyber Range Institute to manage user VM communications. The current, out-of-the-box, solution provided by VMWare is not customizable. The project will provide new functionalities and web pages.</br>


## Two Main Purposes
### A: Communication Through vCenter
Currently, OCRI channels user VM communications through vRealize. </br>
However, vRealize is not optimal for managing large quantities of user VM communications.</br>
Thus, the first goal was to channel all user VM communication through vCenter.

### B: Enable Uploading and Accessing of Lab Materials

Currently, students need to view lab materials via another system such as Canvas.</br>
The project adds pages and backend capabilities that enable instructors to upload different course lab materials such as text, videos, and images.</br>
Students can view lab materials side-by-side with their VM on the same web page.</br></br>
