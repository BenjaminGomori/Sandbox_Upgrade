# Sandbox Update

Updating the current OCRI front and back end that UC uses to enable instructors and students to communicate with VMs. </br>
## Two Main Purposes
### A: Communication Through vCenter
Currently, the system channels VM communications through vRealize. </br>
However, vRealize is not optimal for managing large quantities of VM communication.</br>
Thus, the first goal is to channel all VM communication to go through vCenter.

### B: Enable Uploading and Accessing of Lab Materials for Instructors and Students

Currently, students need to view lab materials via another system such as Canvas.</br>
The project aims to add pages and backend capabilities to enable instructors to upload the different models' lab content including text, videos, and images.</br>
The project will also provide students to view the lab materials side by side with the VM in the same web tab.</br></br>

### Additionally the project aims to improve overall user experience by creating a new front-end design.
